# 📊 Sales Data Analysis – Internship Project

## 🏢 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my **Data Analytics Internship**.  
The objective was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), execute SQL queries to extract key business insights, and design a static KPI dashboard mock-up.

The analysis was performed on a Sales Dataset to understand revenue trends, profitability, and relationships between multiple variables.

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze correlation between variables
- Extract key performance indicators (KPIs) using SQL
- Create a static dashboard mock-up
- Document findings professionally on GitHub

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional sales data including:

- **Amount** → Revenue generated per transaction  
- **Profit** → Profit earned  
- **Quantity** → Number of units sold  
- Additional categorical fields (if available)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔹 Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values
- Verified data types
- Selected numeric columns for correlation analysis

### 🔹 Multivariate Analysis
- Scatter Plot (Amount vs Profit)
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pair Plot for multiple variable relationships

---

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Sales**
- **Total Profit**
- **Total Quantity Sold**
- **Profit Margin (%)**
- **Average Order Value**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Strong positive correlation between **Sales Amount and Profit**
- Revenue significantly influences profitability
- Quantity alone does not strongly impact profit
- Profit margin helps measure business efficiency

---

## 🗄️ SQL Analysis

SQL queries were written to calculate:

- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Total Quantity
- Profit Margin
- Average Order Value
- Top 5 highest sales transactions

This demonstrates the ability to extract business insights directly from structured databases.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Mock-up

A static dashboard was created including:

- KPI summary section
- Business insights
- Performance indicators

The dashboard provides a quick overview of company performance and supports data-driven decision-making.

- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Correlation & Multivariate Analysis  
- SQL Query Writing  
- KPI Identification  
- Dashboard Design  
- Business Insight Reporting  
- GitHub Documentation
